| Name            | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                |

## üõ† Usage

**Basic Example (with Automatic Locale Detection)**

```yaml
name: Upload to Lingohub

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Upload to Lingohub
        uses: lingohub/upload-action@v1
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.LINGOHUB_API_KEY }}
          workspace_url: https://app.lingohub.com/your-workspace
          project_url: https://app.lingohub.com/your-workspace/your-project
          files: ./locales/en.yml,./locales/email/*.yml
```

Specifying a Locale

```yaml
name: Upload to Lingohub

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Upload English Source Files
        uses: lingohub/upload-action@v1
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.LINGOHUB_API_KEY }}
          workspace_url: https://app.lingohub.com/your-workspace
          project_url: https://app.lingohub.com/your-workspace/your-project
          files: ./locales/en/*.json
          locale: en
```

### üìù Locale Handling
Use locale: auto (default) to let Lingohub automatically detect the locale from your files.
Use a specific language code (e.g., en, de, fr) to explicitly set the locale for *all uploaded files*.

### Source vs. Target Files
Recommended: Upload only your source files (e.g., English originals).
It is possible to upload both source and target files by specifying multiple patterns in the files input. Lingohub will automatically detect the correct locale. However, the order of processing the files is important. For best results and to avoid confusion, upload only source files.
