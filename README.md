## üõ† Usage

**Basic Example (Automatic Locale Detection)**

```yaml
name: Upload to Lingohub

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Upload to Lingohub
        uses: lingohub/upload-action@v1
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.LINGOHUB_API_KEY }}
          project_id: pr_18JCETCbSz7e-40731
          files: ./locales/en.yml,./locales/email/*.yml
```

### üìù Locale Handling
Locale is detected automatically by Lingohub. No need to specify a locale.

### Source vs. Target Files
Recommended: Upload only your source files (e.g., English originals).
It is possible to upload both source and target files by specifying multiple patterns in the files input. Lingohub will automatically detect the correct locale. However, the order of processing the files is important. For best results and to avoid confusion, upload only source files.
